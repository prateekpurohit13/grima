	// less severe. Noisy-OR is monotonic — a signal can only add — which is the

	// Corroboration is structural, not arithmetic (Sprint 4, item 4.9). A
	// Secondary signal may not carry a verdict; its weight applies only while at

	// every Secondary weight below the medium band — bounds each signal but not
	// a combination of them, and it is a property of the (weight, band) pair
	// rather than of the tier: with the shipped weights, delete_rate +
	// dir_fanout + cum_bytes_rewritten + ngram_rename_chain + bus_drops, all
	// saturated and nothing else present, fuses to 86.2 high. static_reputation,
	// a Secondary in design.md §5, is configured at 0.6 — 60.0 medium — for the
	// day Phase 7 emits it. Gating on a Primary makes both impossible at any
	// band value, so the tier's meaning no longer depends on where the band is
	// set.
	// A Primary opens the gate only if it actually contributes. A muted signal —
	// no weight entry, or a weight of zero — is not evidence, so letting it gate
	// would reinstate exactly the Secondary-only fusion the gate exists to
