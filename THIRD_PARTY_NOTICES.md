# Third-Party Notices

GRIMA incorporates third-party software and adapts detection logic from published
sources. This file records every such component with its license and copyright holder,
as required by those licenses.

If you add a dependency or adapt detection logic from another project, add an entry here
in the same commit. This is a licensing requirement, not a courtesy.

### Transitive dependencies

These are required by the direct dependencies above and are statically linked into the
binary on the platforms that use them. They are listed because the shipped artifact
contains their code: a notices file that covers four of the eleven modules in `go.mod`
understates what is being distributed. Each entry gives the license and a stable link to
the pinned license text, per the convention at the end of this file.

None is copyleft, so none relicenses the project. Adding a module to `go.mod` means adding
it here in the same commit.

## Adapted detection logic

### SigmaHQ rule corpus

**Used for:** the detection logic behind the hard rules `R-SHADOW-DELETE`,
`R-EVENTLOG-CLEAR`, `R-USN-DELETE`, `R-BACKUP-KILL`, `R-FIREWALL-OFF`,
`R-SERVICE-TAMPER`, and `R-EDR-KILL`, which encode known pre-encryption,
anti-recovery, and detection-evasion command patterns. The specific Sigma rules
consulted, with their identifiers and authors, are:

| Sigma rule | ID | Author(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Shadow Copies Deletion Using Operating Systems Utilities | `c947b146-0abc-4c87-9c64-b17e9d7274a2` | Florian Roth (Nextron Systems), Michael Haag, Teymur Kheirkhabarov, Daniil Yugoslavskiy, oscd.community, Andreas Hunkeler (@Karneades) |
| Boot Configuration Tampering Via Bcdedit.EXE | `1444443e-6757-43e4-9ea4-c8fc705f79a2` | E.M. Anhaus (Atomic Blue Detections, Endgame), oscd.community |
| Suspicious Eventlog Clearing or Configuration Change Activity | `cc36992a-4671-4f21-a91d-6c2b72a2edf5` | Ecco, Daniil Yugoslavskiy, oscd.community, D3F7A5105, Swachchhanda Shrawan Poudel (Nextron Systems) |
| Firewall Disabled via Netsh.EXE | `57c4bf16-227f-4394-8ec7-1b745ee061c3` | Fatih Sirin |
| Suspicious Windows Service Tampering | `ce72ef99-22f1-43d4-8695-419dcb5d9330` | Nasreddine Bencherchali (Nextron Systems), frack113, X__Junior (Nextron Systems) |
| Taskkill Symantec Endpoint Protection | `4a6713f6-3331-11ed-a261-0242ac120002` | Ilya Krestinichev, Florian Roth (Nextron Systems) |

The anti-recovery command patterns (`vssadmin delete shadows`, `wevtutil cl`,
`fsutil usn deletejournal`, `wbadmin delete catalog`, `bcdedit` recovery and boot
status tampering, backup-service termination) are derived from the same corpus.

**License:** Detection Rule License (DRL) 1.1 — see
https://github.com/SigmaHQ/Detection-Rule-License/blob/main/LICENSE.Detection.Rules.md
and https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/LICENSE.Detection.Rules.md

**Copyright:** the source rules are copyright their individual authors, listed in
the table above; attribution is retained per the DRL 1.1 condition.

The rules in GRIMA are **independent reimplementations as Go predicates**, not
verbatim copies of Sigma YAML. The command patterns and severity rationale are derived
from the corpus. One deliberate narrowing: Sigma flags `vssadmin resize shadowstorage`
whenever a `/MaxSize=` is given, whereas GRIMA matches only the destructive zero case
(`maxsize=0`) so routine storage resizing does not trip a hard override.

## Design inspiration (no code or rule text taken)

These works informed the architecture. They are cited in the paper's Related Work
section; no code was copied.

| Source | Contribution to GRIMA's design |
|---|---|
| RansomWall — Shaukat & Ribeiro, COMSNETS 2018 | Layered defense: pre-execution check, decoy files, continuous filesystem monitoring; fusing entropy with additional checks rather than relying on entropy alone |
| UNVEIL — Kharraz et al., USENIX Security 2016 | The kernel-level detection approach and its stability/portability costs, which motivate GRIMA's user-space stance |
| ShieldFS — Continella et al., ACSAC 2016 | Self-healing filesystem semantics; kernel minifilter architecture used as the counterexample |
| Huertas Celdrán et al., *Computers & Security* 2023, DOI `10.1016/j.cose.2023.103510` | Behavioral fingerprinting for ransomware detection |
| EldeRan — Sgandurra et al. 2016 | The fixed-observation-window weakness that motivates the rolling window |
| Davies & Macfarlane, *Sensors* 2022 | Comparison of entropy calculation methods for encrypted-file identification |
| Al-Rimy et al., *Computers & Security* 2018 | Ransomware taxonomy and threat-success-factor survey |

## Rejected for licensing or architectural reasons

Recorded so the decision is not re-litigated:

| Project | Reason |
|---|---|
| `nccgroup/KilledProcessCanary` | Kernel driver; violates the user-space constraint |
| `RafWu/RansomWatch` | Windows minifilter driver; violates the user-space constraint |
| Any GPL / AGPL component | Copyleft is viral; incorporating it would relicense the whole project |

---

## Adding an entry

For a **dependency**: name and version, what it is used for, license, the full license
text or a stable link to it, and the copyright holder.

For **adapted logic**: the source project, the license, what was adapted, and an explicit
statement of whether the adaptation is a reimplementation or a copy.

For **inspiration only**: state clearly that no code was taken, so the distinction stays
auditable.
